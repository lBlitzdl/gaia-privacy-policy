2. Processing of Personal Data

2.1 User Data

The app allows users to interact
with a specially tailored version
of GPT 3.5. To enable this functionality,
the app sends and stores chat and
provided user feedback data to
conduct new training runs and
improve the application.
All data is anonymized before
storage and cannot be associated with
any specific individual.

2.2 Transmission to OpenAI

To facilitate communication between
the user and the AI, the anonymized
chat data is inevitably transmitted
to OpenAI. OpenAI is the provider of
the GPT 3.5 technology. The transmitted
data is also anonymized and cannot be
associated with any specific individual.

2.3 Purpose of Data Processing

The processing of anonymized data is
solely for the purpose to run and improve
the service. Data is used to optimize the
functionality of the app and provide a
better user experience.

2.4 Data Security

We take high technical and organizational
measures to ensure the security and
confidentiality of the anonymized data.
The data is encrypted and protected to
prevent unauthorized access.

2.5 Rights of Data Subjects

As anonymization ensures that data can
no longer be attributed to an identifiable
individual, the data falls outside the
scope of the GDPR.
